Updated by Flowng

A silent, spreading backdoor for Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers.
Using the injector is recommended, should you choose to manually backdoor a plugin, you're on your own if you run into problems.
Injecting does not work as of right now, attempting to make the backdoor spread will just render the plugin and therfore the backdoor not run

For educational purposes only. Do not use on a server you do not own.

## Requirements:
* Java 8 runtime.
* Desired target plugin jar file

## GUI Usage:
* Run backdoor-(version).jar.
* Select desired plugin file.
* Input your Minecraft UUID.
* Input chat command prefix. (Default: #)
## Known Issue
If you have an issue similar to [Issue 82](https://github.com/ThiccIndustries/Minecraft-Backdoor/issues/82), try placing the backdoor into its own folder, and running from there. Do not try to run from the Start Menu.
## CLI Usage:
Java -jar backdoor.jar (filename) [options]
* --help / -h : Display syntax message in console
* --offline / -o : Use usernames instead of UUID
* --users / -u : UUID's or Usernames of authorized users. If not used, all users will be allowed.
* --prefix / -p (Default: '#') : Prefix for backdoor commands.
* --discord /-d : Discord webhook url. See Readme.
* --spread / -s : Spread to other plugins.
* --debug / -b : Send debug messages in console. Use this before creating issue reports.
